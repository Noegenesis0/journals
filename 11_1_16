1.Our Project already has batteries included to it.

2.Our project does not require us to convert to pcb. We are programing a drone.

3.Sadly no because our darn computer doesnt want to upload any of the code to our smart inventor board, otherwise we would have 
plenty done.

4.Possibly going home and trying to upload on my laptop which I will attempt if our code still wont upload today.
