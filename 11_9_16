Now i cant say i learned as much on the area of coding as i did in the area of engineering, i learned from souldering with price
, gaining more knowledge in circuits, it was a more of an experience with building than a experience with the code because in all
honesty we did piggyback with price and he did the code.Although I do remember seeing some if else loops for making the led 
transitioning speed up which i already understand the concept of.But my main job was helping price with all the hardware based 
things.
