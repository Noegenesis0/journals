  The 3 types of people are stoppers, movers and movers with a plan. The most succesful one will immediatly be the movers with a
  plan and this is because they know what they are doing its as simple as that. Hands on coding is a great way to learn both the 
  engineering and coding side of things but its honestly great for any situation, taking things into your own hands teaches you 
  more because it was something that impacted your life in a way and it sticks to you because of it, thats why i love these types
  of projects they test hands on skills and teamwork skills.
